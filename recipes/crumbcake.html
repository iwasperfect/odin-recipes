    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>This dish is easy to throw together and perfect for breakfast, a snack, or after-dinner dessert!</p>

        <h5>Ingredients:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 3/4 cup of white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
            <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 cups hulled and halved straberries</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Steps:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a 9-inch square cake pan with enough parchment paper to have overhang on all sides.</li>
            <li>Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg together in a large bowl until combined. Cut in butter until mixture resembles wet sand. Measure out 1 cup of the crumb mixture to use for the topping, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add buttermilk, eggs, and vanilla to remaining mixture in the bowl. Mix just until there are no dry clumps of flour remaining. Fold in strawberries.</li>
            <li>Pour cake batter into the prepared pan and smooth into an even layer. Sprinkle 1 cup reserved crumb mixture evenly over the top.</li>
            <li>Bake cake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out with a few moist crumbs, 60 to 65 minutes. Allow cake to cool completely in pan before carefully lifting out of the pan using the parchment overhang. Cut and serve.</li>
        </ol>
