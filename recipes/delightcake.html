        <h5>Ingredients:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16.5 ounce) package strawberry cake mix</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package frozen sweetened strawberries, thawed but not drained</li>
            <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) container frozen whipped topping (such as Cool Whip), thawed</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h5>Steps:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Mix strawberry cake mix, water, eggs, and oil together in a bowl using an electric mixer on low speed. Increase speed to medium and mix batter for 2 minutes. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the middle of the cake comes out clean, 24 to 27 minutes.</li>
            <li>Poke holes all over the cake using the handle of a wooden spoon. Pour sweetened condensed milk over cake, letting it seep into the holes. Cool cake to room temperature, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Bake cake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out with a few moist crumbs, 60 to 65 minutes. Allow cake to cool completely in pan before carefully lifting out of the pan using the parchment overhang. Cut and serve.</li>
        </ol>
