        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups whole buttermilk</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h5>Frosting:</h5>

        <li>1 1/2 cups unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>4 cups powdered sugar, sifted</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons heavy cream, or more if needed</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h5>Crumble::</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>25 golden Oreo cookies</li>
        <li>2/3 cup freeze-dried strawberries</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons melted unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h5>Directions:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat 2 (8-inch) round cake pans with baking spray with flour and line bottoms with parchment.</li>
        <li>To make the cake: Whisk flour, gelatin, baking powder, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Beat butter at medium speed until creamy, 2 to 3 minutes in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Gradually add sugar, beating until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating on low speed and scraping down sides of bowl as needed, until just combined. Beat in vanilla.</li>
        <li>Add flour mixture in 3 additions alternately with buttermilk, beginning and ending with flour mixture and beating on low speed just until combined after each addition. Divide batter evenly between prepared pans.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean, about 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cool in pans on a wire rack for 10 minutes; remove cakes from pans and cool completely on a wire rack, 1 to 1 1/2 hours</li>
        <li>To make the frosting: Add butter and salt to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat on medium speed until creamy, about 3 minutes. Beat in vanilla.</li>
        <li>Gradually add powdered sugar, alternately with cream, beating on low speed until completely incorporated and smooth. Increase mixer speed to medium-high and beat until smooth and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>To make the crumble mixture: Place cookies, strawberries, and salt in a food processor and pulse until slightly chunky (bits of strawberry and cookie should still be visible), about 12 pulses. Drizzle in butter and pulse about 5 times to combine.</li>
        <li>Trim tops of cakes with a serrated knife if needed to make flat on top.</li>
        <li>Place 1 cake layer on serving platter; spread evenly with 1 cup frosting. Top with remaining cake layer.</li>
        <li>Spread top and sides of cake with the remaining frosting.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle crumble mixture over top and sides of cake, pressing lightly to adhere until completely covered. Chill cake for 1 hour before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
